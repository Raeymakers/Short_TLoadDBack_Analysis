# Short_TLoadDBack
analysis of the effeciency of the shortened DLoadDback in tiring participants

This study uses the TLoadDback paradigm to manipulate Cognitive Fatigue (CF) between participants.
There are two conditions: High Cognitive Load (HCL) and Low Cognitive Load (LCL).
The hypothesis is that the HCL condition will have higher CF than the LCL.
CF is measured by the VAS-f questionnaire and the PVT (a reaction time task). 
the VAS-f and PVT are measured before and after the task and are named VAS-f-1, PVT-1 and VAS-f-2, PVT-2 respectively.

The task was done twice, with at least 24 hours in between. this way we have a test-retest measure
